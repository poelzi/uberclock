• django 1.2

To install the database run:

  ./manage.py installdb

Now you have a default user named "user" with password "user".

== Run ==
To run the daemon run:

  ./uberclockd

== Architecture ==

UberClock contains of different components:

• uberclockd
  Is a daemon which is usally run to connect to the motition detectors and 
  provide data via http html/json/xml to the frontend.
  It can also start programs on events so no support from a already running 
  frontend (the actual alarm clock) is required as long as it can be 
  triggered somehow.
• html frontend. uberclockd has a built in webserver. 
• frontend (planned)
  a nice qt frontend, maybe alarm flip clock https://garage.maemo.org/projects/flipclock/
